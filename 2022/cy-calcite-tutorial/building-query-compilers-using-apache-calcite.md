# Building query compilers using Apache Calcite

*Where:*  CY Cergy Paris University

*When:* February 21, 2022

*Duration:* 4h30 minutes

*Abstract:*

In this tutorial, we demonstrate the main components of Calcite and how they interact with each other.
To do this we build, step-by-step, a fully fledged query processor for data residing in multiple data sources.
We chose Apache Lucene (NoSQL) and HyperSQL (SQL) as storage engines to demonstrate how Calcite can be used on top of SQL and NoSQL systems.
