# An introduction to query processing & Apache Calcite

*Where:* Calcite Online Meetup

*When:* January 21, 2021

*Duration:* 40 minutes

*Abstract:*

In this talk, I will go over some basic notions around query processors and demonstrate how they map to concepts in Calcite.
I will start with some simple use-cases and show how from Java code we can go to relational algebra and SQL, explaining the importance of a declarative language and the role of a query processing framework.
Then, I will focus on the query processor, illustrating the general architecture and the main components of Apache Calcite.
After a simple end to end example of the different modules, I will perform a live coding session demonstrating how we can put together the main components of Calcite to build a simple query processor for in-memory data.
